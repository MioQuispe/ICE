# ICE

ICE is a powerful task runner and CLI tool for the Internet Computer (similar to hardhat). With ICE, you can create composable workflows, simplify complex setups, and manage canister deployments using TypeScript instead of bash, taking the development experience of the Internet Computer to the next level.

## Features

- **Composable:** Built with composability in mind. Complex workflows & setups can easily be abstracted away.
- **Type-Safe Configuration**: Get immediate feedback on invalid canister arguments and dependencies. Leverage the full power of TypeScript.
- **Npm install canisters:** Easily install & integrate common canisters (e.g. ICRC1, Ledger, NFID, Internet Identity) from NPM with zero setup.
- **Smart context:** Access environment variables, user Principals, or custom config from a single ‚Äúcontext object‚Äù in the deployment scripts
- **VSCode Extension:** Run tasks from inside your editor. Actor call results displayed inline in your editor, no console logs needed

## Quick Start

1. Install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   npm i -S @ice.ts/runner @ice.ts/canisters
   ```

2. Create an `ice.config.ts` file in your project root:
   ```typescript
   import { motokoCanister } from '@ice.ts/runner';

   export const my_canister = motokoCanister({
     src: 'canisters/my_canister/main.mo',
   })
   ```

3. Build your canisters:
   ```bash
   npx ice
   ```

4. Run custom tasks:
   ```bash
   npx ice run <task-name>
   ```
