# What is Crystal?

Crystal is a command-line tool (CLI) and SDK designed to simplify and automate complex `dfx` tasks for Internet Computer developers. It provides a TypeScript interface for managing canisters, making canister-related tasks composable and easier to automate.

## Key Features

- **TypeScript-Based Configuration**: Replace `dfx.json` with a more ergonomic and type-safe `crystal.config.ts` file.
- **Task Automation**: Create tasks with dependency chains and asynchronous logic.
- **Boilerplate Generation**: Quickly generate starter templates for tokens, NFTs, and DAOs.
- **Canister Installation via npm**: Install and manage canisters directly from npm.
- **Declarations and Type Generation**: Automatically generate TypeScript declarations and types for your canisters.

Crystal aims to improve the developer experience and productivity when working with the Internet Computer platform.
